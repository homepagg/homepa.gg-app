                    Online privacy is important. Baile only asks for the
                    permissions and data it needs in order to do its job. You
                    always remain in full, sole control and can revoke our
                    access to anything and everything at any time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What&rsquo;s more, outside of the permissions we do ask for,
                    Baile does not access, store or transmit any of your
                    information or data. Ever. But you don&rsquo;t have to take
                    our word for it. Baile is fully open source an you can{' '}

                <h3>Your Location</h3>
                <p>
                    If you choose to have your theme change at sunrise and
                    sunset, Baile will ask you for your location. This
                    information is only stored in your browser as part of your
                    current session. It is never transmitted or saved anywhere
                    else, including Dropbox.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If at any point you wish to stop allowing Baile to access
                    your location, simply click the lock icon in your
                    browser&rsquo;s address bar and revoke that permission. The
                    next time Baile asks you for your location, simply say no.
                    Don&rsquo;t worry, this doesn't break anything. When we
                    don&rsquo;t know your location we simply assume you live in
                    San Francisco (howdy, neighbor!) and will use that as your
                    location.
